    <p>The Proxy profile for Tor Browser puts a proxy behind the circuit's exit node for all connections and connects to
        a local Tor service
        with no Tor circuit isolation capability. This means that it will be much easier for websites to track you. Only
        use this profile as a means to circumvent Tor restrictions on websites like Reddit. If you want to log into
        accounts on such websites, NEVER log-in via a clearnet profile or browser and only use this proxy profile; do
        not use it for anything else such as regular off-site browsing as they will be able to associate the activity
        with your account. For maximum anonymity, use a different final proxy for each account you access through this configuration.</p>
